Protect your device! Until we receive, inspect and pay for your device, remember, you still own it. Wrap each device securely with bubble wrap or other packing material to protect your item during shipment. If you are sending in multiple items be sure to individually wrap each item, so they will not damage each other during shipment. <\/p><p>2. Choose an appropriately sized box. Choose a box with enough room for 2 inches of cushioning material around all sides of the contents. Remember to include any accessories that came with the item, including original box and packaging if possible. <\/p><p>3. The Test (important): Close and gently shake the box. Is there enough padding to keep the device secure? Or is the device bouncing around inside? If it’s bouncing around, add more newspaper, packing foam, or cushioning material. This is important. Vidlogix will not be held responsible for damage to your items that may occur during shipping. <\/p><p>4. Tape your box shut and reinforce the seams with 2\" wide tape. Use clear or brown packaging tape, reinforced packing tape, or paper tape. Do not use cord, string, or twine. If you’re reusing a box, cover up or black out any old labels and markings.<\/p>","button_link2":"","button_text2":"Button text","button_chat2":false,"text2":"","anchor_link":""}},"2f5648c2-92d9-41a3-bd13-894bdf1a7288":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"How do I ship my item?","map_popup":false,"map_text":"","text":"<p>1.
